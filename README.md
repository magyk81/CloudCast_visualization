Assuming Plane is the same size as a Cessna Skyhawk, it has a length (tip to tail) of 8.3 meters.
The difference between the tip and tail of the model in Main Camera Coordinates is 7.6 units. That is near enough that 
to let the camera units be meters.

Area of Interest:
altitude: sea level (0) to 21,028 meters
longitude: -80 to -70 degrees (785,000 meters at north side, 851,000 m at south side)
latitude: 40 to 45 degrees (556,000 meters at both east and west side)

vertical voxel resolution: 240 meters.
