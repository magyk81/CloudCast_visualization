Assuming Plane is the same size as a Cessna Skyhawk, it has a length (tip to tail) of 8.3 meters.
The difference between the tip and tail of the model in Main Camera Coordinates is 7.6 units. That is near enough that 
to let the camera units be meters.

Size of Flight Demo -> Clouds -> Container: 4800 x 4800

voxel resolution: 240 x 240 x 240 meters.

Area of Interest:\
altitude: sea level (0) to 21,028 meters\
longitude: -80 to -70 degrees (785,000 meters at north side, 851,000 m at south side)\
latitude: 40 to 45 degrees (556,000 meters at both east and west side)

Cloud containers: 177 x 198 Cloud containers for a total of 35,046 containers.
